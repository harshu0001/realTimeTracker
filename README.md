# Real Time Tracker
### Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time tracking system built using Node.js, EJS, and Async. It provides a visual representation of a user's location on a map, updating in real-time as the user moves.

### Features

**Real-time location tracking:** The system continuously fetches the user's location and updates the map accordingly.

**Interactive map:** The map allows users to zoom in and out, pan around, and view detailed information about their location.

**EJS templating:** EJS is used to dynamically generate the HTML content, making the application more flexible and maintainable.

**Asynchronous operations:** Async is used to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently, ensuring smooth performance and responsiveness.
